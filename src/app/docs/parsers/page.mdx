# Slither

Sunya uses [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) for static analysis of EVM smart contracts. Slither works on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Run `sunya install` to install it.

- **Vulnerabilities** — Reentrancy, unchecked external calls, unsafe low-level calls
- **Best practices** — Naming conventions, unused state variables
- **Solidity** — Version constraints, compiler warnings

Slither integrates with Foundry—it compiles via `forge build` and runs 100+ detectors. Output includes file paths, line numbers, and references to detector documentation.
