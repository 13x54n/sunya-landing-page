# Project Structure

Sunya scans your contracts directory recursively. Here's how your project is typically organized:

```
your-project/
├── contracts/              ← Auto-scanned recursively
├── sunya.config.json       ← Your tool config
├── package.json
└── node_modules/.bin/sunya ← Runs from here
```

## Key files

- `contracts/` — Sunya finds all Solidity files here automatically
- `sunya.config.json` — Define tools, parsers, and output format
