# Project Structure

Sunya runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It scans your contracts directory recursively. Here's how your project is typically organized:

## Your project

```mdx
your-project/
├── src/                    ← Foundry: contracts go here
│   └── *.sol
├── contracts/             ← Or Hardhat/standard layout
│   └── *.sol
└── sunya.config.json       ← Optional: set contractsDir
```

## Key files

- `contracts/` or `src/` — Sunya finds all `.sol` files recursively. Foundry uses `src/`, others often use `contracts/`.
- `sunya.config.json` — Optional. Set `contractsDir` and `output` format.

Run `sunya install` to set up Slither. Then `sunya scan` analyzes your contracts and reports vulnerabilities.
